# Documentation triage

Documentation is hosted in [github](https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-server-documentation)
and from there rendered to PDF and the online view at [Ubuntu Server docs](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/server).
This kind of structure gave us better interaction rates and contributions than
on Discourse, but to make them worthwhile we need to ensure we pick up and act
on what we get there

## Lists

For the daily triage rotation you only have to look at those issues or pull
requests created or updated in the time your duty covers.

- [Pull requests](https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-server-documentation/pulls)
- [Issues](https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-server-documentation/issues)

Check what the interaction is about and help them to progress and land or resolve.
