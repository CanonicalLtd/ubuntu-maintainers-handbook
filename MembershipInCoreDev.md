Membership in Core-Developers
-----------------------------

Core developers maintain all packages in Ubuntu, most notably including uploading to the 'main' component.  CoreDev members also have elevated privileges for retriggering autopkgtests and performing other administrative actions in the distro.


Application Process
-------------------

0.  Plan ahead of time to start attending the [DMB meetings](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DeveloperMembershipBoard/Agenda) as you prepare your application.  If there is a queue of applications, you'll want to reserve a spot early since the meetings are held every 2 weeks and only 2 applications are processed per meeting.

1.  Training and Preparation.  See the following section for details.

2.  Prepare Application Form in Wiki.

3.  Collect Endorsements


Training and Preparation
------------------------

Most people applying for CoreDev will have a history of involvement in Ubuntu, working their way up from [PackageSet](MembershipInPackageSet.md) and/or [MOTU](MembershipInMOTU.md) membership.  If you're skipping over those levels it is worth reviewing their training and application processes to make sure you'll be fulfilling their requirements.

In addition to understanding common tasks documented in this guide, including [patching](DebianPatch.md), [SRU's](PackageFixing.md), and so on, CoreDev applicants must also have a good understanding of these advanced packaging skills, and ideally direct experience with a few of them:

  * [Package Sponsorship](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MOTU/Sponsorship/SponsorsQueue)
  * [Seed handling](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SeedManagement)
  * [Main inclusion](MainInclusion.md) for packages
  * [New package](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuDevelopment/NewPackages) integration
  * [Transition](Transitions.md) of packages with new ABI/API requirements
  * [SRU special case exceptions](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/StableReleaseUpdates#Documentation_for_Special_Cases)

Like empahsized with [MOTU](MembershipInMOTU.md), trustworthiness is crucial for CoreDev.  Being able to work with others, and especially *mentoring* others is extremely important.  Look for opportunities to exercise and demonstrate these attributes, and make mention of them in your application.


Further Information
-------------------

While core-dev is the highest level for packaging development, there are several specialized administrative teams that help keep the archive healthy.

  * [Archive Administration](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ArchiveAdministration)
  * [SRU Administration](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuDevelopers#SRUDevelopers)
