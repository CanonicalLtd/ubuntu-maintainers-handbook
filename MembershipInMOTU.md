Membership in MOTU
------------------

MOTU, or "Masters of the Universe", maintain the large collection of packages in the 'universe' and 'multiverse' components (i.e. things not in 'main').


Application Process
-------------------

0.  Keep an eye on the [DMB agenda](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DeveloperMembershipBoard/Agenda), noting when the upcoming meetings are and if there is a queue of applicants; if so, make sure to add yourself to the "Ubuntu MOTU Developer Applications" bullet, since only 2 applications are considered per meeting.

1.  Training and Preparation, as needed.  See the following section for details.

2.  Prepare [Application Form](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DeveloperMembershipBoard/ApplicationProcess) in Wiki.

3.  Collect Endorsements from people who have reviewed or sponsored your packages, or worked with you on noteworthy packaging efforts.  Seek out diversity in your endorsers by looking outside your immediate team.  Since MOTU is more focused on the community maintainers, their testimonials are of particular value.  Even words from noteworthy Debian maintainers can carry weight for MOTU applications.


Training and Preparation
------------------------

The decision on granting MOTU upload rights is a question of both skill and trust, with the latter often seen as the more imperative.

Trust, in the context of Ubuntu packaging, means:

  * Doing it the right way, even when not required
  * Picking the more difficult solution when it will give better results
  * Welcoming constructive criticism, without getting defensive
  * Asking for help or advice if you're at all uncertain
  * "Measuring twice, cuting once"
  * Highlighting, not hiding, the thing you broke
  * Following through on tasks you commit to do
  * Helping someone succeed, even though you don't agree

Demonstration of trust is more important than mastery of skills, because a lack of skill is straightforward to solve by more training and practice, but if someone demonstrates a lack of trust, that is not so easily fixed!  Everyone makes mistakes, and an error caused by inexperience can itself be a learning opportunity, and an opportunity to demonstrate trustworthiness.  So watch for opportunities to work on challenging problems outside your comfort zone.  Keep track of experiences that went well, and fess up to disasters and how you used them as valuable learning experiences.

Now to skills.  At a minimum you must have mastery of the same skills as a [Packageset Uploader](MembershipInPackageSet) would have, so work through all the items on that page's Training and Preparation section, focusing on anything you're uncomfortable with.  The main difference with MOTU is *breadth*.  Make sure you have direct experience in these skills across a broader range of packages throughout the archive, including types of software you've never worked on.

More advanced packaging topics you should master as a MOTU applicant include:

  * Package merges from upstream, to go ahead of Debian's version
  * [Ubuntu's release process](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuDevelopment/ReleaseProcess), including the
    [freeze exception process](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FreezeExceptionProcess)
  * Understand the main/universe split, and how that affects dependencies
  * [Seed Management](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SeedManagement), the [Main Inclusion Process](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MainInclusionProcess) and [Component Mismatches](https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/component-mismatches-proposed.html)
  * [NBS](https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/nbs.html)
  * [Multiarch](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MultiarchCross) issues
  * [Autopkgtest](PackageTests.md) writing and fixing, and understanding of the [spec](https://salsa.debian.org/ci-team/autopkgtest/-/blob/master/doc/README.package-tests.rst)
  * [Proposed migration](ProposedMigration.md) basics, and the [process in general](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ProposedMigration)
  * [Transition](Transitions.md) basics, and the [library transitions process](https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/transitions/) generally

You don't need to have completed tasks in all of the above topics, but should have direct and deep experience in at least some, and a solid understanding of most.  Be prepared to answer technical questions about these topics at the application meeting, as you'll likely be asked one or two.

Finally, an important element of MOTU is working with the wider Ubuntu development community.  Find a way to engage yourself with current community discussions and look for opportunities to contribute.
